NetLogo Bird Evolution Game Revamped

Description:
I took the NetLogo bird breeding game and changed up the gameplay a bit to make some parts easier and add fun visuals. 
It is a genetics game through NetLogo where you selectively breed birds to create a target bird with specific genetic traits while managing your budget and (optionally) competing against other players.

Changes I Made:
- Starting Funds: Changed from $500 to $1,000
- Bird Size: Changed from 0.8 to 0.9 to be bigger
- Your Cage Color: Changed from turquoise to sky blue
- Player Colors: Changed from pink, green, brown, and gray to bright red, lime green, orange, and violet
- Birds features: Changed color schemes, hair - (yellow/orange/red gradient), wings - (blue gradient), chest - (white/gray/black), and tails - (lime/green/dark green gradient)

Gameplay Changes:
- Starting Birds: Changed from 3 to 4 birds for player 4 (you)
- Egg Color: Changed from blue to cyan
- Egg Size: Changed from 0.5 to 0.6 to be bigger
- Goal Bird Genetics: Changed from all recessive (aa bb cc dd) to mixed (Aa bb CC Dd)

Summary:
- What looks different: Birds are now purple with colorful rainbow traits instead of gray, cages are bright colors, eggs are cyan and bigger
- What plays different: Start with $1,000 and 4 birds instead of $500 and 3 birds, goal bird is now "Aa bb CC Dd" instead of "aa bb cc dd"
