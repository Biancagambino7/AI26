  <h1>Agents in Computing</h1>

  <h2>Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)</h2>
  <p>
    Agent-Based Modeling is a way to simulate a system made up of many individual “agents,” like people or animals. 
    Each agent follows simple rules, and by watching how they interact, researchers can see how complex patterns and behaviors form over time.

  <h2>Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP)</h2>
  <p>
    Agent-Oriented Programming is a way to build computer programs using “agents” that can think and act on their own. 
    Each agent can make decisions, respond to its environment, and work with other agents to get things done, kind of like a team of smart bots working together.
